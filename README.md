# Turso3D

Experimental 3D / game engine technology partially based on the Urho3D codebase. Expected to remain in an immature or "toy" state for the time being.

Goals:

- Minimally intrusive structure that is more a library than a framework
- Utilize modern rendering API's
- Minimal 3rd party dependencies
- Cache- and multithreading-friendly data structures and operation
- Unified representation (scene graph) for 3D scene and UI
